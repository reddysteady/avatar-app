## 2. Technical Specifications

### 2.1 Requirements Analysis

The AI-Driven Avatar system needs to perform three core functions:

1. **Data Training & Learning**: The system must ingest and learn from an influencer's existing content (posts, comments, videos) to understand their communication style, common responses, and personality traits.

2. **Multi-Platform Message Management**: The system must connect to multiple social media platforms, retrieve incoming messages, identify appropriate responses, and post those responses on behalf of the influencer.

3. **Safety & Control**: The system must provide robust controls to prevent inappropriate responses, ensure brand safety, and allow the influencer to maintain oversight of all automated communications.

These core functions are supported by a user interface that allows influencers to set up, monitor, and control their avatar's behavior.

### 2.4 Open Questions

1. **Content Boundaries**: How should the avatar determine what is within its knowledge sphere and what should be escalated to the human influencer?

2. **Data Freshness**: How frequently should the system re-train on new influencer content to stay current with evolving messaging and topics?

3. **Audience Transparency**: Should the system disclose to audience members that they are interacting with an AI avatar? If so, how and when?

4. **Response Diversity**: How can we ensure responses don't become repetitive while maintaining authenticity to the influencer's voice?

5. **Platform Limitations**: How will the system handle potential rate limiting from social media APIs?
