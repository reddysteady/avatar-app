# AI-Driven Avatar for Influencers - System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the PRD, we'll develop a web application that connects influencers' social media accounts, processes messages using AI, and provides a dashboard for control and analytics. We'll focus on creating a scalable and modular architecture that supports the key requirements while ensuring flexibility for future enhancements.

The system will consist of the following major components:

1. **Frontend Application**: A React-based web dashboard for influencers to configure, monitor, and control their avatar
2. **Backend Services**: Node.js/Express API services for handling business logic, authentication, and third-party integrations
3. **AI Engine**: LLM-based system that processes messages and generates appropriate responses
4. **Social Media Integration**: Connectors for Instagram and YouTube APIs with expansion capabilities
5. **Data Storage**: MongoDB for user data, configurations, and interaction history

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **For AI Response Generation**: We'll use OpenAI's API with fine-tuning capabilities to personalize responses. This approach provides state-of-the-art language generation while allowing customization based on the influencer's content and style.

2. **For Social Media Connectivity**: We'll implement platform-specific adapters using official APIs (Meta API for Instagram, YouTube Data API) with OAuth authentication to ensure secure access to influencer accounts.

3. **For Scalability**: We'll use a microservices architecture with service boundaries aligned with key functional areas. This will allow independent scaling of message processing, AI training, and user-facing components.

4. **For Real-time Features**: We'll implement WebSockets (via Socket.io) for delivering real-time updates to the dashboard, including new messages and notification alerts.

5. **For Data Processing**: We'll use background job processing (Bull.js with Redis) to handle data training tasks and large-volume message processing asynchronously.

### Open Source Libraries

1. **Frontend**:
   - React for UI framework
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Redux Toolkit for state management
   - Chart.js for analytics visualizations
   - React Router for navigation
   - Axios for API requests

2. **Backend**:
   - Express.js for API framework
   - Mongoose for MongoDB ODM
   - Passport.js for authentication
   - Bull.js for job processing
   - Winston for logging
   - Jest for testing

3. **DevOps**:
   - Docker for containerization
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Influencer authenticates with the Avatar App
   - App requests OAuth permissions for social media platforms
   - Tokens are securely stored for subsequent API calls

2. **Training Flow**:
   - Initial setup triggers content scraping from authenticated platforms
   - Content is processed, analyzed, and used to fine-tune the LLM
   - Training job runs asynchronously and notifies when complete

3. **Message Processing Flow**:
   - Background services poll social media platforms for new messages
   - Messages are classified and routed (auto-respond/manual review)
   - AI model generates responses based on influencer's style
   - Responses are either automatically sent or queued for approval

4. **Analytics Flow**:
   - Interaction data is stored and aggregated
   - Dashboard pulls metrics through API endpoints
   - Periodic reports are generated and can be exported

## Scaling Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Each microservice can be independently scaled based on demand. Message processing will likely require more resources than other services.

2. **Database Scaling**: MongoDB sharding for message history as volume grows

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement backoff strategies for social media APIs to prevent hitting rate limits

4. **Caching Layer**: Redis will be used to cache frequently accessed data and reduce database load

## Security Considerations

1. **OAuth Security**: Secure storage of access tokens with regular rotation

2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

3. **Input Validation**: Rigorous validation of all user inputs and API responses

4. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for team accounts

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Application Monitoring**: Performance metrics, error rates, and service health

2. **AI Response Quality**: Tracking confidence scores and user corrections

3. **User Activity**: Audit logs for configuration changes and manual interventions

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **API Rate Limits**: The PRD mentions concerns about social media API rate limits. We should establish clear guidelines on message polling frequency and implement adaptive throttling.

2. **Training Data Volume**: The exact volume of training data needed for effective personality matching is unclear. Initial implementation should establish metrics to determine minimum viable training set size.

3. **Moderation Implementation**: The exact criteria for routing messages to human review needs further refinement. We should develop a configurable rule engine that can be adjusted based on early usage patterns.

4. **Subscription Tier Limitations**: The PRD specifies subscription tiers but doesn't detail exact feature/volume limitations per tier. This should be clarified during implementation.

5. **Platform-Specific Limitations**: Each social media platform has unique constraints on automated interactions. We need to document these limitations clearly for users.
